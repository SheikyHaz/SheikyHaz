- 👋 Hi, I’m @SheikyHaz, but it's just a nickname that I like to use. My real name is Haziel Sanchez.
     I’m currently a student at the National University of Engineering and I am preparing to be a systems engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and improving APIs, I also want to learn about automation. For automation, I would like to specialize in Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. In Python, specifically about file handling, I’m also learning how to use the 'matplotlib' library. I frequently review and improve my skills in the fundamentals of programming, be it algorithms, data structures, or objects. This frequent improvement makes me learn and improve at object-oriented programming. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects that help me reinforce my skills and knowledge, as well as acquire knowledge about how APIs work and how to apply Machine Learning.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
